# minipass

A _very_ minimal implementation of a [PassThrough
stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_passthrough)

[It's very
fast](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K_HR5oh3r80b8WVMWCPPjfuWXUgfkmhlX7FGI6JJ8tY/edit?usp=sharing)
for objects, strings, and buffers.

Supports `pipe()`ing (including multi-`pipe()` and backpressure
transmission), buffering data until either a `data` event handler
or `pipe()` is added (so you don't lose the first chunk), and
most other cases where PassThrough is a good idea.

There is a `read()` method, but it's much more efficient to
consume data from this stream via `'data'` events or by calling
`pipe()` into some other stream. Calling `read()` requires the
buffer to be flattened in some cases, which requires copying
memory.

If you set `objectMode: true` in the options, then whatever is
written will be emitted. Otherwise, it'll do a minimal amount of
Buffer copying to ensure proper Streams semantics when `read(n)`
is called.

`objectMode` can only be set at instantiation. Attempting to
write something other than a String or Buffer without having set
`objectMode` in the options will throw an error.

This is not a `through` or `through2` stream. It doesn't
transform the data, it just passes it right through. If you want
to transform the data, extend the class, and override the
`write()` method. Once you're done transforming the data however
you want, call `super.write()` with the transform output.

## Usage in TypeScript

The `Minipass` class takes three type template definitions:

- `RType` the type being read, which defaults to `Buffer`. If
  `RType` is `string`, then the constructor _must_ get an options
  object specifying either an `encoding` or `objectMode: true`.
  If it's anything other than `string` or `Buffer`, then it
  _must_ get an options object specifying `objectMode: true`.
- `WType` the type being written. If `RType` is `Buffer` or
  `string`, then this defaults to `ContiguousData` (Buffer,
  string, ArrayBuffer, or ArrayBufferView). Otherwise, it
  defaults to `RType`.
- `Events` type mapping event names to the arguments emitted
  with that event, which extends `Minipass.Events`.

To declare types for custom events in subclasses, extend the
third parameter with your own event signatures. For example:

```js
import { Minipass } from 'minipass'

// a NDJSON stream that emits 'jsonError' when it can't stringify
export interface Events extends Minipass.Events {
  jsonError: [e: Error]
}

export class NDJSONStream extends Minipass<string, any, Events> {
  constructor() {
    super({ objectMode: true })
  }

  // data is type `any` because that's WType
  write(data, encoding, cb) {
    try {
      const json = JSON.stringify(data)
      return super.write(json + '\n', encoding, cb)
    } catch (er) {
      if (!er instanceof Error) {
        er = Object.assign(new Error('json stringify failed'), {
          cause: er,
        })
      }
      // trying to emit with something OTHER than an error will
      // fail, because we declared the event arguments type.
      this.emit('jsonError', er)
    }
  }
}

const s = new NDJSONStream()
s.on('jsonError', e => {
  // here, TS knows that e is an Error
})
```

Emitting/handling events that aren't declared in this way is
fine, but the arguments will be typed as `unknown`.

## Differences from Node.js Streams

There are several things that make Minipass streams different
from (and in some ways superior to) Node.js core streams.

Please read these caveats if you are familiar with node-core
streams and intend to use Minipass streams in your programs.

You can avoid most of these differences entirely (for a very
small performance penalty) by setting `{async: true}` in the
constructor options.

### Timing

Minipass streams are designed to support synchronous use-cases.
Thus, data is emitted as soon as it is available, always. It is
buffered until read, but no longer. Another way to look at it is
that Minipass streams are exactly as synchronous as the logic
that writes into them.

This can be surprising if your code relies on
`PassThrough.write()` always providing data on the next tick
rather than the current one, or being able to call `resume()` and
not have the entire buffer disappear immediately.

However, without this synchronicity guarantee, there would be no
way for Minipass to achieve the speeds it does, or support the
synchronous use cases that it does. Simply put, waiting takes
time.

This non-deferring approach makes Minipass streams much easier to
reason about, especially in the context of Promises and other
flow-control mechanisms.

Example:

```js
// hybrid module, either works
import { Minipass } from 'minipass'
// or:
const { Minipass } = require('minipass')

const stream = new Minipass()
stream.on('data', () => console.log('data event'))
console.log('before write')
stream.write('hello')
console.log('after write')
// output:
// before write
// data event
// after write
```

### Exception: Async Opt-In

If you wish to have a Minipass stream with behavior that more
closely mimics Node.js core streams, you can set the stream in
async mode either by setting `async: true` in the constructor
options, or by setting `stream.async = true` later on.

```js
// hybrid module, either works
import { Minipass } from 'minipass'
// or:
const { Minipass } = require('minipass')

const asyncStream = new Minipass({ async: true })
asyncStream.on('data', () => console.log('data event'))
console.log('before write')
asyncStream.write('hello')
console.log('after write')
// output:
// before write
// after write
// data event <-- this is deferred until the next tick
```

Switching _out_ of async mode is unsafe, as it could cause data
corruption, and so is not enabled. Example:

```js
import { Minipass } from 'minipass'
const stream = new Minipass({ encoding: 'utf8' })
stream.on('data', chunk => console.log(chunk))
stream.async = true
console.log('before writes')
stream.write('hello')
setStreamSyncAgainSomehow(stream) // <-- this doesn't actually exist!
stream.write('world')
console.log('after writes')
// hypothetical output would be:
// before writes
// world
// after writes
// hello
// NOT GOOD!
```

To avoid this problem, once set into async mode, any attempt to
make the stream sync again will be ignored.

```js
const { Minipass } = require('minipass')
const stream = new Minipass({ encoding: 'utf8' })
stream.on('data', chunk => console.log(chunk))
stream.async = true
console.log('before writes')
stream.write('hello')
stream.async = false // <-- no-op, stream already async
stream.write('world')
console.log('after writes')
// actual output:
// before writes
// after writes
// hello
// world
```

### No High/Low Water Marks

Node.js core streams will optimistically fill up a buffer,
returning `true` on all writes until the limit is hit, even if
the data has nowhere to go. Then, they will not attempt to draw
more data in until the buffer size dips below a minimum value.

Minipass streams are much simpler. The `write()` method will
return `true` if the data has somewhere to go (which is to say,
given the timing guarantees, that the data is already there by
the time `write()` returns).

If the data has nowhere to go, then `write()` returns false, and
the data sits in a buffer, to be drained out immediately as soon
as anyone consumes it.

    return super.end(chunk, encoding, callback)
  }
}

someSource.pipe(new Logger()).pipe(someDest)
```

### same thing, but using an inline anonymous class

```js
// js classes are fun
someSource
  .pipe(
    new (class extends Minipass {
      emit(ev, ...data) {
        // let's also log events, because debugging some weird thing
        console.log('EMIT', ev)
        return super.emit(ev, ...data)
      }
      write(chunk, encoding, callback) {
        console.log('WRITE', chunk, encoding)
        return super.write(chunk, encoding, callback)
      }
      end(chunk, encoding, callback) {
        console.log('END', chunk, encoding)
        return super.end(chunk, encoding, callback)
      }
    })()
  )
  .pipe(someDest)
```

### subclass that defers 'end' for some reason

```js
class SlowEnd extends Minipass {
  emit(ev, ...args) {
    if (ev === 'end') {
      console.log('going to end, hold on a sec')
      setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('ok, ready to end now')
        super.emit('end', ...args)
      }, 100)
      return true
    } else {
      return super.emit(ev, ...args)
    }
  }
}
```

### transform that creates newline-delimited JSON

```js
class NDJSONEncode extends Minipass {
  write(obj, cb) {
    try {
      // JSON.stringify can throw, emit an error on that
      return super.write(JSON.stringify(obj) + '\n', 'utf8', cb)
    } catch (er) {
      this.emit('error', er)
    }
  }
  end(obj, cb) {
    if (typeof obj === 'function') {
      cb = obj
      obj = undefined
    }
    if (obj !== undefined) {
      this.write(obj)
    }
    return super.end(cb)
  }
}
```

### transform that parses newline-delimited JSON

```js
class NDJSONDecode extends Minipass {
  constructor(options) {
    // always be in object mode, as far as Minipass is concerned
    super({ objectMode: true })
    this._jsonBuffer = ''
  }
  write(chunk, encoding, cb) {
    if (
      typeof chunk === 'string' &&
      typeof encoding === 'string' &&
      encoding !== 'utf8'
    ) {
      chunk = Buffer.from(chunk, encoding).toString()
    } else if (Buffer.isBuffer(chunk)) {
      chunk = chunk.toString()
    }
    if (typeof encoding === 'function') {
      cb = encoding
    }
    const jsonData = (this._jsonBuffer + chunk).split('\n')
    this._jsonBuffer = jsonData.pop()
    for (let i = 0; i < jsonData.length; i++) {
      try {
        // JSON.parse can throw, emit an error on that
        super.write(JSON.parse(jsonData[i]))
      } catch (er) {
        this.emit('error', er)
        continue
      }
    }
    if (cb) cb()
  }
}
```
